## printf Function
The _printf function is a custom implementation of the C printf function that takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, and prints the formatted output to the console.

##Usage
To use the _printf function, include the main.h header file in your C program:

#include "main.h"
Then, call the _printf function with the desired format string and arguments:

int num = 42;
char str[] = "world";
_printf("Hello, %s! The answer is %d.\n", str, num);
This will print the following to the console:

Hello, world! The answer is 42.
Note that the format string contains two format specifiers: %s and %d. The first %s specifier is replaced with the string "world", and the second %d specifier is replaced with the integer value 42. The newline character \n at the end of the format string is printed as-is.

##Supported Format Specifiers
This _printf implementation supports the following format specifiers:

%c for characters
%s for strings
%d and %i for signed decimal integers
%u for unsigned decimal integers
%x and %X for hexadecimal integers (lowercase and uppercase, respectively)
%o for octal integers
%p for pointers
%% for a literal '%' character
Return Value
The _printf function returns the number of characters printed to the console, or a negative value if an error occurred.
